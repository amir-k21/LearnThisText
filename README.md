# LearnThisText
It's an application to help you for learning a new language(in this case German, if you want to add other languages you just need to upload your words in the database).

you can choose a txt file or copy your text directly to the program. it gives you statistics of the number of the words and you can sort them to find the most used vocabulaires in the given text. you can right click on each word and click on highlight to highlight the word in the text.

there is a dictionary that you can search a word(english to german or german to english) based on topic and part of speech.

if you have selected a text and you are reading a text these words that you search, even if they are not in your text, will be saved under the vocabulaires you're learning for this text. if you haven't selected any text then all the vocabularies you want to add to library will be saved under the a text called other.

you can later choose a text and see the vocabulaires you were learning in the text.

I didn't upload all the dictionary but you can download the words from dict.cc which is an amazing dictionary for german language.

it has more that 1 million entries in it.

you can export as jar convert it to exe with launch4j and make it installable with inno.

I used Javafx and sqlite for this program.

Happy learning.
